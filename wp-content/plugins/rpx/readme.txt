The RPX wordpress plugin lets you use OpenID, Facebook Connect,
Twitter, MySpace, Google, Yahoo!, and Windows Live ID authentication
on your blog.  Great for comment authentication or just getting users
signed in to your blog/community without having to create yet another
account. It uses JanRain's RPX authentication service at
https://rpxnow.com/

== Description ==

[RPX](https://rpxnow.com/ "RPX") allows your site or blog to accept
logins via Facebook Connect, Google, Yahoo, Twitter, MySpaceID, AOL,
Windows Live ID, and all other OpenID providers, through the use of a
single and easy to deploy API.  With the RPX wordpress plugin, your
site or blog benefits from:

* Increased user registrations and social engagement.
* Adds passwordless sign-in and commenting to your blog using OpenID, Google, Yahoo!, Facebook, MySpace, Windows Live ID, and Twitter.
* Create new accounts without registering and maintaining a password.
* Easy to configure with no template modifications requried.
* Verified identity and provider icons for blog commenters.

== Installation ==

1. Copy the `rpx` directory and its contents to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the rpx plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Visit the RPX configuration page by going to 'Settings' ->
'Options,' and follow the instructions to finish your installation.
If you don't already have an RPX account and API key, you may click
the "Get an RPX API Key" button to kick off the automatic configuation
of your wordpress installation.  If you have already created an RPX
account and site for your WordPress blog, just past your API Key into
the box and click "Save."  That's it!


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I enable Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, and Live ID authentication? =

Go to https://rpxnow.com/ and sign-in.  In the left navigation bar
there is a tab for each of those providers which includes instructions
for setting up each one.  All three require you to obtain an API key
and secret for your individual site, and approve their developer terms
of service.

= Help! The plugin doesn't work = 

Send as much information about your php/wordpress version and runtime
as you can to brian -at- janrain.com.  We'll do our best to get the
plugin working with your configuration.

Note: using a modern version of PHP and Wordpress usually fixes most
problems, so make sure you are up to date.
