Collection of different projects I've merged the repositories together on.

These are various projects I've worked on in the years and many of them stem from Second Life.

My use of Git is very crude as I was learning how to use it. 
To me, at the time, the very use of Git and branching off of existing code was good enough for me.

Some of my best ideas are in here somewhere, eventually I will dig them out, clean them up and publish them in a different repo.
