This theme has a couple of extra features in it.

* BRIEFS-
	The "Briefs" section on the sidebar will
	show two (2) posts that are in the category
	"shorts" (without quotations). So, in
	order to have your posts go on the sidebar,
	you will need to create a category named
	"shorts" (lower case, no quotes) and put
	any post you want on the sidebar in it.

* FLICKR-
	The "Flickr" part on the right sidebar,
	by default, shows five pictures from flickr
	that are tagged "blackandwhite". If you do
	not know what Flickr is, visit it at
	www.flickr.com. They are displayed randomly,
	and it is not likely that you will see one 
	shown twice. You can customize the number
	of photos and the tag in sidebar.php.

* HEADER IMAGE-
	Change the header image by replacing
	"header.jpg" with your own.

*FONT-
	The font used for the images in this theme
	is called "Base 02" and is downloadable at
	dafont.com.
